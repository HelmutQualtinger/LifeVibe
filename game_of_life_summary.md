Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The "game" is played on an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states: alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

The evolution of the game follows these simple rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules are applied simultaneously to every cell on the grid to compute the next generation. The game is Turing complete and can simulate any computation.
